7. How to build

VS.NET
------
There are two solution file for different version of VS.NET

* Spring.Net.2008.sln for use with VS.NET 2008
* Spring.Net.2010.sln for use with VS.NET 2010

Note:
When building on Vista/Windows7 with activated UAC, you might get an error:

xcopy
"C:\Spring.Net\Spring.NET-1.3.2\Spring.NET\test\Spring\Spring.Core.Tests\Spring.Core.Tests.dll.config"
..\..\..\..\build\VS.Net.2008\Spring.Core.Tests\Debug\ /y /s /q-Command exited with Code 9009.	Spring.Core.Tests.2008

In this case you need to run Visual Studio with Administrator-permissions. (note that the first part of this path is an example only)

NAnt
----

Build scripts are delivered with the download package.

To build the source and run the unit tests type

build test

If you want to run the build to create strongly signed assemblies you can generate a key file by executing the following command (assuming that sn.exe is properly on your search path):

sn -k Spring.Net.snk

You need to place the Spring.NET.snk file into the root folder of the source tree. All builds are strongly named using this key file when executing the following nant command:

nant -D:project.build.sign=true

8. Support

The user forums at http://forum.springframework.net/ are available for you to submit questions, support requests, and interact with other Spring.NET users.

Bug and issue tracking can be found at https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPRNET

A Fisheye repository browser is located at https://fisheye.springframework.org/browse/spring-net

To get the sources, fork us on github at https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-net

We are always happy to receive your feedback on the forums. If you think you found a bug, have an improvement suggestion or feature request, please submit a ticket in JIRA (see link above).

A word on bug reports: If at all possible, try to download one of the nightly snapshots at http://www.springframework.net/downloads/nightly/ and see, if this bug has already been fixed. If the problem still persists, don't forget to mention the version of Spring.NET you are using (check the file versions of Spring.NET dlls), the .NET version you are running on and a description how to reproduce the problem.
Ideally attach some sample code reproducing the problem to the JIRA ticket.
