    <p>This is an introductory guide to Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP)
    with Spring.NET.</p>

    <p>This guide assumes little to no prior experience of having
    <span class="emphasis"><em>used</em></span> Spring.NET AOP on the part of the reader.
    However, it <span class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span> assume a certain familiarity with
    the terminology of AOP in general. It is probably better if you have read
    (or at least have skimmed through) the AOP section of the reference
    documentation beforehand, so that you are familiar with a) just what AOP
    is, b) what problems AOP is addressing, and c) what the AOP concepts of
    <code class="literal">advice</code>, <code class="literal">pointcut</code>, and
    <code class="literal">joinpoint</code> actually mean... this guide spends absolutely
    zero time defining those terms. Having said all that, if you are the kind
    of developer who learns best by example, then by all means follow along...
    you can always consult the reference documentation as the need arises (see
    <a class="xref" href="aop.html#aop-introduction-defn" title="13.1.1.&nbsp;AOP concepts">Section&nbsp;13.1.1, &#8220;AOP concepts&#8221;</a>).</p>

    <p><span class="emphasis"><em> The examples in this guide are <span class="bold"><strong>intentionally</strong></span> simplistic. One of the core aims of
    this guide is to get you up and running with Spring.NET's flavor of AOP in
    as short a time as possible. Having to comprehend even a simple object
    model in order to understand the AOP examples would not be conducive to
    learning Spring.NET AOP. It is left as an exercise for the reader to take
    the concepts learned from this guide and apply them to his or her own code
    base. Again, having said all of that, this guide concludes with a number
    of cookbook-style AOP 'recipes' that illustrate the application of
    Spring.NET's AOP offering in a real world context; additionally, the
    Spring.NET reference application contains a number of Spring.NET AOP
    aspects particular to it's own domain model (see <a class="xref" href="springair.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;41.&nbsp;SpringAir - Reference Application">Chapter&nbsp;41, <i>SpringAir - Reference Application</i></a>). </em></span></p>

    <p>This initial section introduces the basics of defining and then
    applying some simple advice.</p>

    <div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="aop-quickstart-basics-advice"></a>38.2.1.&nbsp;Applying advice</h3></div></div></div>
      

      <p>Lets see (a very basic) example of using Spring.NET AOP. The
      following example code simply applies advice that writes the details of
      an advised method call to the system console. Admittedly, this is not a
      particularly compelling or even useful application of AOP, but having
      worked through the example, you will then hopefully be able to see how
      to apply your own custom advice to perform useful work (transaction
      management, auditing, security enforcement, thread safety, etc).</p>

      <p>Before looking at the AOP code proper lets quickly look at the
      domain classes that are the target of the advice (in Spring.NET AOP
      terminology, an instance of the following class is going to be the
      <span class="emphasis"><em>advised object</em></span>.</p>

      <pre class="programlisting"><span style="color: #0000FF">public</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">interface</span> ICommand 
{
    <span style="color: #0000FF">object</span> Execute(<span style="color: #0000FF">object</span> context);
}

<span style="color: #0000FF">public</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">class</span> ServiceCommand : ICommand
{
    <span style="color: #0000FF">public</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">object</span> Execute(<span style="color: #0000FF">object</span> context)
    {
        Console.Out.WriteLine(<span style="color: #A31515">"Service implementation : [{0}]"</span>, context);
        <span style="color: #0000FF">return</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">null</span>;
    }
}</pre>

      <p>Find below the advice that is going to be applied to the
      <code class="literal">object Execute(object context)</code> method of the
      <code class="literal">ServiceCommand</code> class. As you can see, this is an
      example of <span class="emphasis"><em>around advice</em></span> (see <a class="xref" href="aop.html#aop-introduction-advice-types" title="13.3.2.&nbsp;Advice types">Section&nbsp;13.3.2, &#8220;Advice types&#8221;</a>).</p>

      <pre class="programlisting">    <span style="color: #0000FF">public</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">class</span> ConsoleLoggingAroundAdvice : IMethodInterceptor

          <code class="literal">returnValue</code>

        </td></tr></table></div>

      <p>So thus far we have three artifacts: an interface
      (<code class="literal">ICommand</code>); an implementation of said interface
      (<code class="literal">ServiceCommand</code>); and some (trivial) advice
      (encapsulated by the <code class="literal">ConsoleLoggingAroundAdvice</code>
      class). All that remains is to actually apply the
      <code class="literal">ConsoleLoggingAroundAdvice</code> advice to the invocation
      of the <code class="literal">Execute()</code> method of the
      <code class="literal">ServiceCommand</code> class. Lets look at how to effect this
      programmatically...</p>

      <pre class="programlisting">    ProxyFactory factory = <span style="color: #0000FF">new</span> ProxyFactory(<span style="color: #0000FF">new</span> ServiceCommand());
    factory.AddAdvice(<span style="color: #0000FF">new</span> ConsoleLoggingAroundAdvice());
    ICommand command = (ICommand) factory.GetProxy();
    command.Execute(<span style="color: #A31515">"This is the argument"</span>);</pre>

      <p>The result of executing the above snippet of code will look
      something like this...</p>

      <pre class="programlisting">    Advice executing; calling the advised method...
    Service implementation : [This is the argument]
    Advice executed; advised method returned </pre>

      <p>The output shows that the advice (the
      <code class="literal">Console.Out</code> statements from the
      <code class="literal">ConsoleLoggingAroundAdvice</code> was applied
      <span class="emphasis"><em>around</em></span> the invocation of the advised method.</p>

      <p>So what is happening here? The fact that the preceding code used a
      class called <code class="literal">ProxyFactory</code> may have clued you in. The
      constructor for the <code class="literal">ProxyFactory</code> class took as an
      argument the object that we wanted to advise (in this case, an instance
      of the <code class="literal">ServiceCommand</code> class). We then added some
      advice (a <code class="literal">ConsoleLoggingAroundAdvice</code> instance) using
      the <code class="literal">AddAdvice()</code> method of the
      <code class="literal">ProxyFactory</code> instance. We then called the
      <code class="literal">GetProxy()</code> method of the
      <code class="literal">ProxyFactory</code> instance which gave us a proxy... an
      (AOP) proxy that proxied the target object (the
      <code class="literal">ServiceCommand</code> instance), and called the advice (a
      single instance of the <code class="literal">ConsoleLoggingAroundAdvice</code> in
      this case). When we invoked the <code class="literal">Execute(object
      context)</code> method of the proxy, the advice was
      <code class="literal">'applied'</code> (executed), as can be seen from the
      attendant output.</p>

      <p>The following image shows a graphical view of the flow of
      execution through a Spring.NET AOP proxy.</p>

      <div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/aop-chain.png"></div>

      <p>One thing to note here is that the AOP proxy that was returned
      from the call to the <code class="literal">GetProxy()</code> method of the
      <code class="literal">ProxyFactory</code> instance was cast to the
      <code class="literal">ICommand</code> interface that the
      <code class="literal">ServiceCommand</code> target object implemented. This is
      very important... currently, Spring.NET's AOP implementation mandates
      the use of an interface for advised objects. In short, this means that
      in order for your classes to leverage Spring.NET's AOP support, those
      classes that you wish to use with Spring.NET AOP <span class="bold"><strong>must</strong></span> implement at least one interface. In
      practice this restriction is not as onerous as it sounds... in any case,
      it is <span class="emphasis"><em>generally</em></span> good practice to program to
      interfaces anyway (support for applying advice to classes that do not
      implement any interfaces is planned for a future point release of
      Spring.NET AOP).</p>

      <p>The remainder of this guide is concerned with fleshing out some of
      the finer details of Spring.NET AOP, but basically speaking, that's
      about it.</p>

      <p>As a first example of fleshing out one of those finer details,
      find below some Spring.NET XML configuration that does
      <span class="emphasis"><em>exactly</em></span> the same thing as the previous example; it
      should also be added that this declarative style approach to Spring.NET
      AOP is preferred to the programmatic style.</p>

      <pre class="programlisting">    <span style="color: #A31515">&lt;object</span> <span style="color: #FF0000">id</span>=<span style="color: #0000FF">"consoleLoggingAroundAdvice"</span>

        <span style="color: #A31515">&lt;/property&gt;</span>
        <span style="color: #A31515">&lt;property</span> <span style="color: #FF0000">name</span>=<span style="color: #0000FF">"interceptorNames"</span><span style="color: #A31515">&gt;</span>
            <span style="color: #A31515">&lt;list&gt;</span>
                <span style="color: #A31515">&lt;value&gt;</span>consoleLoggingAroundAdvice<span style="color: #A31515">&lt;/value&gt;</span>
            <span style="color: #A31515">&lt;/list&gt;</span>
        <span style="color: #A31515">&lt;/property&gt;</span>
    <span style="color: #A31515">&lt;/object&gt;</span></pre>

      <pre class="programlisting">    ICommand command = (ICommand) ctx[<span style="color: #A31515">"myServiceObject"</span>];
    command.Execute();</pre>

      <p>Some comments are warranted concerning the above XML configuration
      snippet. Firstly, note that the
      <code class="literal">ConsoleLoggingAroundAdvice</code> is itself a plain vanilla
      object, and is eligible for configuration just like any other class...
      if the advice itself needed to be injected with any dependencies, any
      such dependencies could be injected as normal.</p>

      <p>Secondly, notice that the object definition corresponding to the
      object that is retrieved from the IoC container is a
      <code class="literal">ProxyFactoryObject</code>. The
      <code class="literal">ProxyFactoryObject</code> class is an implementation of the
      <code class="literal">IFactoryObject</code> interface;
      <code class="literal">IFactoryObject</code> implementations are treated specially
      by the Spring.NET IoC container... in this specific case, it is not a
      reference to the <code class="literal">ProxyFactoryObject</code> instance itself
      that is returned, but rather the object that the
      <code class="literal">ProxyFactoryObject</code> produces. In this case, it will be
      an advised instance of the <code class="literal">ServiceCommand</code>
      class.</p>

      <p>Thirdly, notice that the target of the
      <code class="literal">ProxyFactoryObject</code> is an instance of the
      <code class="literal">ServiceCommand</code> class; this is the object that is
      going to be advised (i.e. invocations of its methods are going to be
      intercepted). This object instance is defined as an inner object
      definition... this is the preferred idiom for using the
      <code class="literal">ProxyFactoryObject</code>, as it means that other objects
      cannot acquire a reference to the raw object, but rather only the
      advised object.</p>

      <p>Finally, notice that the advice that is to be applied to the
      target object is referred to by its object name in the list of the names
      of interceptors for the <code class="literal">ProxyFactoryObject</code>'s
      <code class="literal">interceptorNames</code> property. In this particular case,
      there is only one instance of advice being applied... the
      <code class="literal">ConsoleLoggingAroundAdvice</code> defined in an object
      definition of the same name. The reason for using a list of object names
      as opposed to references to the advice objects themselves is explained
      in the reference documentation...</p>

      <p><span class="emphasis"><em> '... if the <code class="literal">ProxyFactoryObject</code>'s
      singleton property is set to false, it must be able to return
      independent proxy instances. If any of the advisors is itself a
      prototype, an independent instance would need to be returned, so it is
      necessary to be able to obtain an instance of the prototype from the
      context; holding a reference isn't sufficient.' </em></span></p>
    </div>

    <div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="aop-quickstart-basics-pointcuts"></a>38.2.2.&nbsp;Using Pointcuts - the basics</h3></div></div></div>
      

      <p>The advice that was applied in the previous section was rather
      indiscriminate with regard to which methods on the advised object were
      to be advised... the <code class="literal">ConsoleLoggingAroundAdvice</code>
      simply intercepted <span class="bold"><strong>all</strong></span> methods (that
      were part of an interface implementation) on the target object.</p>

      <p>This is great for simple examples and suchlike, but not so great
      when you only want certain methods of an object to be advised. For
      example, you may only want those methods beginning with
      <code class="literal">'Start'</code> to be advised; or you may only want those
      methods that are called with specific runtime argument values to be
      advised; or you may only want those methods that are decorated with a
      <code class="literal">Lockable</code> attribute to be advised.</p>

      <p>The mechanism that Spring.NET AOP uses to discriminate about where
      advice is applied (i.e. which method invocations are intercepted) is
      encapsulated by the <code class="literal">IPointcut</code> interface (see <a class="xref" href="aop.html#aop-pointcuts" title="13.2.&nbsp;Pointcut API in Spring.NET">Section&nbsp;13.2, &#8220;Pointcut API in Spring.NET&#8221;</a>). Spring.NET provides many out-of-the-box
      implementations of the <code class="literal">IPointcut</code> interface... the
      implementation that is used if none is explicitly supplied (as was the
      case with the first example) is the canonical
      <code class="literal">TruePointcut</code> : as the name suggests, this pointcut
      always matches, and hence <span class="bold"><strong>all</strong></span> methods
      that can be advised will be advised.</p>

      <p>So let's change the configuration of the advice such that it is
      only applied to methods that contain the letters
      <code class="literal">'Do'</code>. We'll change the <code class="literal">ICommand</code>
      interface (and it's attendant implementation) to accommodate
      this...</p>

      <pre class="programlisting">    <span style="color: #0000FF">public</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">interface</span> ICommand 
    {
        <span style="color: #0000FF">void</span> Execute();

        <span style="color: #0000FF">void</span> DoExecute();
    } 

    <span style="color: #0000FF">public</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">class</span> ServiceCommand : ICommand
    {
        <span style="color: #0000FF">public</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">void</span> Execute()
        {
            Console.Out.WriteLine(<span style="color: #A31515">"Service implementation : Execute()..."</span>);
        }

        <span style="color: #0000FF">public</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">void</span> DoExecute()
        {
            Console.Out.WriteLine(<span style="color: #A31515">"Service implementation : DoExecute()..."</span>);
        }
    }</pre>

      <p>Please note that the advice itself (encapsulated within the
      <code class="literal">ConsoleLoggingAroundAdvice</code> class) does not need to
      change; we are changing <span class="emphasis"><em>where</em></span> this advice is
      applied, and not the advice itself.</p>

      <p>Programmatic configuration of the advice, taking into account the
      fact that we only want methods that contain the letters
      <code class="literal">'Do'</code> to be advised, looks like this...</p>

      <pre class="programlisting">    ProxyFactory factory = <span style="color: #0000FF">new</span> ProxyFactory(<span style="color: #0000FF">new</span> ServiceCommand());
    factory.AddAdvisor(<span style="color: #0000FF">new</span> DefaultPointcutAdvisor(
        <span style="color: #0000FF">new</span> SdkRegularExpressionMethodPointcut(<span style="color: #A31515">"Do"</span>),
        <span style="color: #0000FF">new</span> ConsoleLoggingAroundAdvice()));
    ICommand command = (ICommand) factory.GetProxy();
    command.DoExecute();</pre>

      <p>The result of executing the above snippet of code will look
      something like this...</p>

      <pre class="programlisting">    Intercepted call : about to invoke next item <span style="color: #0000FF">in</span> chain...
    Service implementation...
    Intercepted call : returned</pre>

      <p>The output indicates that the advice was applied around the
      invocation of the advised method, because the name of the method that
      was executed contained the letters <code class="literal">'Do'</code>. Try changing
      the pertinent code snippet to invoke the <code class="literal">Execute()</code>
      method, like so...</p>

      <pre class="programlisting">    ProxyFactory factory = <span style="color: #0000FF">new</span> ProxyFactory(<span style="color: #0000FF">new</span> ServiceCommand());

            <span style="color: #0000FF">new</span> ConsoleLoggingAroundAdvice()));
    ICommand command = (ICommand) factory.GetProxy();

    <i style="color: #008000">// note that there is no 'Do' in this method name</i>
    command.Execute();</pre>

      <p>Run the code snippet again; you will see that the advice will not
      be applied : the pointcut is not matched (the method name does not
      contain the letters <code class="literal">'Do'</code>), resulting in the following
      (unadvised) output...</p>

      <p>You'll will perhaps have noticed that this treatment of pointcuts
      introduced the concept of an <code class="literal">advisor</code> (see <a class="xref" href="aop.html#aop-advisors" title="13.4.&nbsp;Advisor API in Spring.NET">Section&nbsp;13.4, &#8220;Advisor API in Spring.NET&#8221;</a>). An advisor is nothing more the composition
      of a pointcut (i.e. <span class="emphasis"><em>where</em></span> advice is going to be
      applied), and the advice itself (i.e. <span class="emphasis"><em>what</em></span> is going
      to happen at the interception point). The
      <code class="literal">consoleLoggingAroundAdvice</code> object defines an advisor
      that will apply the advice to all those methods of the advised object
      that match the pattern <code class="literal">'Do'</code> (the pointcut). The
      pattern to match against is supplied as a simple string value to the
      <code class="literal">pattern</code> property of the
      <code class="literal">RegularExpressionMethodPointcutAdvisor</code> class.</p>
    </div>

  <div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="aop-quickstart-going-deeper"></a>38.3.&nbsp;Going deeper</h2></div></div></div>
    

    <p>The first section should (hopefully) have demonstrated the basics of
    firstly defining advice, and secondly, of choosing where to apply that
    advice using the notion of a pointcut. Of course, there is a great deal
    more to Spring.NET AOP than the aforementioned single advice type and
    pointcut. This section continues the exploration of Spring.NET AOP, and
    describes the various advice and pointcuts that are available for you to
    use (yes, there is more than one type of advice and pointcut).</p>

    <div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="aop-quickstart-going-deeper-other-advice-types"></a>38.3.1.&nbsp;Other types of Advice</h3></div></div></div>
      

      <p>The advice that was demonstrated and explained in the preceding
      section is what is termed <span class="emphasis"><em>'around advice'</em></span>. The name
      <span class="emphasis"><em>'around advice'</em></span> is used because the advice is
      applied <span class="emphasis"><em>around</em></span> the target method invocation. In the
      specific case of the <code class="literal">ConsoleLoggingAroundAdvice</code>
      advice that was defined previously, the target was made available to the
      advice as an <code class="literal">IMethodInvocation</code> object... a call was
      made to the <code class="literal">Console</code> class before the target was
      invoked, and a call was made to the <code class="literal">Console</code> class
      after the target method invocation was invoked. The advice surrounded
      the target, one could even say that the advice was totally 'around' the
      target... hence the name, <span class="emphasis"><em>'around advice'</em></span>.</p>

      <p><span class="emphasis"><em>'around advice'</em></span> provides one with the
      opportunity to do things both <span class="bold"><strong>before</strong></span>
      the target gets a chance to do anything, and <span class="bold"><strong>after</strong></span> the target has returned: one even gets a
      chance to inspect (and possibly even totally change) the return
      value.</p>

      <p>Sometimes you don't need all that power though. If we stick with
      the example of the <code class="literal">ConsoleLoggingAroundAdvice</code> advice,
      what if one just wants to log the fact that a method was called? In that
      case one doesn't need to do anything <span class="emphasis"><em>after</em></span> the
      target method invocation is to be invoked, nor do you need access to the
      return value of the target method invocation. In fact, you only want to
      do something <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> the target is to be invoked (in
      this case, print out a message to the system <code class="literal">Console</code>
      detailing the name of the method). In the tradition of good programming
      that says one should use only what one needs and no more, Spring.NET has
      another type of advice that one can use... if one only wants to do
      something <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> the target method invocation is
      invoked, why bother with having to manually call the
      <code class="literal">Proceed()</code> method? The most expedient solution simply
      is to use <span class="emphasis"><em>'before advice'</em></span>.</p>

      <div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="aop-quickstart-going-deeper-before-advice"></a>38.3.1.1.&nbsp;Before advice</h4></div></div></div>
        

        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>'before advice'</em></span> is just that... it is
        advice that runs <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> the target method
        invocation is invoked. One does not get access to the target method
        invocation itself, and one cannot return a value... this is a good
        thing, because it means that you cannot inadvertently forget to call
        the <code class="literal">Proceed()</code> method on the target, and it also
        means that you cannot inadvertently forget to return the return value
        of the target method invocation. If you don't need to inspect or
        change the return value, or even do anything after the successful
        execution of the target method invocation, then <span class="emphasis"><em>'before
        advice'</em></span> is just what you need.</p>

        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>'before advice'</em></span> in Spring.NET is defined by
        the <code class="literal">IMethodBeforeAdvice</code> interface in the
        <code class="literal">Spring.Aop</code> namespace. Lets just dive in with an
        example... we'll use the same scenario as before to keep things
        simple. Let's define the <span class="emphasis"><em>'before advice'</em></span>
        implementation first.</p>

        <pre class="programlisting">    <span style="color: #0000FF">public</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">class</span> ConsoleLoggingBeforeAdvice : IMethodBeforeAdvice
    {
        <span style="color: #0000FF">public</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">void</span> Before(MethodInfo method, <span style="color: #0000FF">object</span>[] args, <span style="color: #0000FF">object</span> target)
        {
            Console.Out.WriteLine(<span style="color: #A31515">"Intercepted call to this method : "</span> + method.Name);
            Console.Out.WriteLine(<span style="color: #A31515">"    The target is               : "</span> + target);
            Console.Out.WriteLine(<span style="color: #A31515">"    The arguments are           : "</span>);
            <span style="color: #0000FF">if</span>(args != <span style="color: #0000FF">null</span>)
            {
                <span style="color: #0000FF">foreach</span> (<span style="color: #0000FF">object</span> arg <span style="color: #0000FF">in</span> args)
                {
                    Console.Out.WriteLine(<span style="color: #A31515">"\t: "</span> + arg);
                }
            }
        }
    }</pre>

        <p>Let's apply a single instance of the
        <code class="literal">ConsoleLoggingBeforeAdvice</code> advice to the invocation
        of the <code class="literal">Execute()</code> method of the
        <code class="literal">ServiceCommand</code>. What follows is programmatic
        configuration; as you can see, its pretty much identical to the
        previous version... the only difference is that we're using our new
        <span class="emphasis"><em>'before advice'</em></span> (encapsulated as an instance of
        the <code class="literal">ConsoleLoggingBeforeAdvice</code> class).</p>

        <pre class="programlisting">    ProxyFactory factory = <span style="color: #0000FF">new</span> ProxyFactory(<span style="color: #0000FF">new</span> ServiceCommand());
    factory.AddAdvice(<span style="color: #0000FF">new</span> ConsoleLoggingBeforeAdvice());
    ICommand command = (ICommand) factory.GetProxy();
    command.Execute();</pre>

        <p>The result of executing the above snippet of code will look
        something like this...</p>

        <pre class="programlisting">    Intercepted call to this method : Execute
    The target is                   : Spring.Examples.AopQuickStart.ServiceCommand
    The arguments are               :</pre>

        <p>The output clearly indicates that the advice was applied
        <span class="bold"><strong>before</strong></span> the invocation of the advised
        method. Notice that in contrast to <span class="emphasis"><em>'around
        advice'</em></span>, with <span class="emphasis"><em>'before advice'</em></span> there is
        no chance of forgetting to call the <code class="literal">Proceed()</code>
        method on the target, because one does not have access to the
        <code class="literal">IMethodInvocation</code> (as is the case with
        <span class="emphasis"><em>'around advice'</em></span>)... similarly, you cannot forget
        to return the return value either.</p>

        <p>If you can use <span class="emphasis"><em>'before advice'</em></span>, then do so.
        The simpler programming model offered by <span class="emphasis"><em>'before

        potentially less things to get wrong.</p>

        <p>Here is the Spring.NET XML configuration for applying our

        <p>Just as <span class="emphasis"><em>'before advice'</em></span> defines advice that
        executes <span class="bold"><strong>before</strong></span> an advised target,
        <span class="emphasis"><em>'after advice'</em></span> is advice that executes <span class="bold"><strong>after</strong></span> a target has been executed.</p>

        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>'after advice'</em></span> in Spring.NET is defined by
        the <code class="literal">IAfterReturningAdvice</code> interface in the
        <code class="literal">Spring.Aop</code> namespace. Again, lets just fire on
        ahead with an example... again, we'll use the same scenario as before
        to keep things simple.</p>

        <pre class="programlisting">    <span style="color: #0000FF">public</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">class</span> ConsoleLoggingAfterAdvice : IAfterReturningAdvice
    {

        {
            Console.Out.WriteLine(<span style="color: #A31515">"This method call returned successfully : "</span> + method.Name);
            Console.Out.WriteLine(<span style="color: #A31515">"    The target was                     : "</span> + target);
            Console.Out.WriteLine(<span style="color: #A31515">"    The arguments were                 : "</span>);
            <span style="color: #0000FF">if</span>(args != <span style="color: #0000FF">null</span>)
            {
                <span style="color: #0000FF">foreach</span> (<span style="color: #0000FF">object</span> arg <span style="color: #0000FF">in</span> args)
                {
                    Console.Out.WriteLine(<span style="color: #A31515">"\t: "</span> + arg);
                }
            }
            Console.Out.WriteLine(<span style="color: #A31515">"    The return value is                : "</span> + returnValue);
        }
    }</pre>

        <p>Let's apply a single instance of the
        <code class="literal">ConsoleLoggingAfterAdvice</code> advice to the invocation
        of the <code class="literal">Execute()</code> method of the
        <code class="literal">ServiceCommand</code>. What follows is programmatic
        configuration; as you can, its pretty much identical to the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>'before advice'</em></span> version (which in turn was pretty
        much identical to the original <span class="emphasis"><em>'around advice'</em></span>
        version)... the only real difference is that we're using our new
        <span class="emphasis"><em>'after advice'</em></span> (encapsulated as an instance of
        the <code class="literal">ConsoleLoggingAfterAdvice</code> class).</p>

        <pre class="programlisting">    ProxyFactory factory = <span style="color: #0000FF">new</span> ProxyFactory(<span style="color: #0000FF">new</span> ServiceCommand());
    factory.AddAdvice(<span style="color: #0000FF">new</span> ConsoleLoggingAfterAdvice());
    ICommand command = (ICommand) factory.GetProxy();
    command.Execute();</pre>

        <p>The result of executing the above snippet of code will look
        something like this...</p>

        <pre class="programlisting">    This method call returned successfully : Execute
    The target was                         : Spring.Examples.AopQuickStart.ServiceCommand
    The arguments were                     :
    The return value is                    : null</pre>

        <p>The output clearly indicates that the advice was applied
        <span class="bold"><strong>after</strong></span> the invocation of the advised
        method. Again, it bears repeating that your real world development
        will actually have an advice implementation that does something useful
        after the invocation of an advised method. Notice that in contrast to
        <span class="emphasis"><em>'around advice'</em></span>, with <span class="emphasis"><em>'after
        advice'</em></span> there is no chance of forgetting to call the
        <code class="literal">Proceed()</code> method on the target, because just like
        <span class="emphasis"><em>'before advice'</em></span> you don't have access to the
        <code class="literal">IMethodInvocation</code>... similarly, although you get
        access to the return value of the target, you cannot forget to return
        the return value either. You can however change the state of the
        return value, typically by setting some of its properties, or by
        calling methods on it.</p>

        <p>The best-practice rule for <span class="emphasis"><em>'after advice'</em></span>
        is much the same as it is for <span class="emphasis"><em>'before advice'</em></span>;
        namely that if you can use <span class="emphasis"><em>'after advice'</em></span>, then
        do so (in preference to using <span class="emphasis"><em>'around advice'</em></span>).
        The simpler programming model offered by <span class="emphasis"><em>'after
        advice'</em></span> means that there is less to remember, and thus less
        things to get potentially wrong.</p>

        <p>A possible use case for <span class="emphasis"><em>'after advice'</em></span>
        would include performing access control checks on the return value of
        an advised method invocation; consider the case of a service that
        returns a list of document URI's... depending on the identity of the
        (Windows) user that is running the program that is calling this
        service, one could strip out those URI's that contain sensitive data
        for which the user does not have sufficient privileges to access. That
        is just one (real world) scenario... I'm sure you can think of plenty
        more that are a whole lot more relevant to your own development
        needs.</p>

        <p>Here is the Spring.NET XML configuration for applying the

      <div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="aop-quickstart-going-deeper-throws-advice"></a>38.3.1.3.&nbsp;Throws advice</h4></div></div></div>
        

        <p>So far we've covered <span class="emphasis"><em>'around advice'</em></span>,
        <span class="emphasis"><em>'before advice'</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>'after
        advice'</em></span>... these advice types will see you through most if
        not all of your AOP needs. However, one of the remaining advice types
        that Spring.NET has in its locker is <span class="emphasis"><em>'throws
        advice'</em></span>.</p>

        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>'throws advice'</em></span> is advice that executes
        when an advised method invocation <span class="emphasis"><em>throws</em></span> an
        exception.. hence the name. One basically applies the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>'throws advice'</em></span> to a target object in much the
        same way as any of the previously mentioned advice types. If during
        the execution of ones application none of any of the advised methods
        throws an exception, then the <span class="emphasis"><em>'throws advice'</em></span>
        will never execute. However, if during the execution of your
        application an advised method <span class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span> throw an
        exception, then the <span class="emphasis"><em>'throws advice'</em></span> will kick in
        and be executed. You can use <span class="emphasis"><em>'throws advice'</em></span> to
        apply a common exception handling policy across the various objects in
        your application, or to perform logging of every exception thown by an
        advised method, or to alert (perhaps via email) the support team in
        the case of particularly of critical exceptions... the list of
        possible uses cases is of course endless.</p>

        <p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>'throws advice'</em></span> type in Spring.NET is
        defined by the <code class="literal">IThrowsAdvice</code> interface in the
        <code class="literal">Spring.Aop</code> namespace... basically, one defines on
        one's <span class="emphasis"><em>'throws advice'</em></span> implementation class what
        types of exception are going to be handled. Lets take a quick look at
        the <code class="literal">IThrowsAdvice</code> interface...</p>

        <pre class="programlisting">    <span style="color: #0000FF">public</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">interface</span> IThrowsAdvice : IAdvice
    {
    }</pre>

        <p>Yes, that is really it... it is a marker interface that has no
        methods on it. You may be wondering how Spring.NET determines which
        methods to call to effect the running of one's <span class="emphasis"><em>'throws
        advice'</em></span>. An example would perhaps be illustrative at this
        point, so here is some simple Spring.NET style <span class="emphasis"><em>'throws
        advice'</em></span>...</p>

        <pre class="programlisting">    <span style="color: #0000FF">public</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">class</span> ConsoleLoggingThrowsAdvice : IThrowsAdvice
    {
        <span style="color: #0000FF">public</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">void</span> AfterThrowing(Exception ex)
        {
            Console.Out.WriteLine(<span style="color: #A31515">"Advised method threw this exception : "</span> + ex);
        }
    }</pre>

        <p>Lets also change the implementation of the
        <code class="literal">Execute()</code> method of the
        <code class="literal">ServiceCommand</code> class such that it throws an
        exception. This will allow the advice encapsulated by the above
        <code class="literal">ConsoleLoggingThrowsAdvice</code> to kick in.</p>

        <pre class="programlisting">    <span style="color: #0000FF">public</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">class</span> ServiceCommand : ICommand
    {
        <span style="color: #0000FF">public</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">void</span> Execute()
        {
            <span style="color: #0000FF">throw</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">new</span> UnauthorizedAccessException();
        }
    }</pre>

        <p>Let's programmatically apply the <span class="emphasis"><em>'throws
        advice'</em></span> (an instance of our
        <code class="literal">ConsoleLoggingThrowsAdvice</code>) to the invocation of
        the <code class="literal">Execute()</code> method of the above
        <code class="literal">ServiceCommand</code> class; to wit...</p>

        <pre class="programlisting">    ProxyFactory factory = <span style="color: #0000FF">new</span> ProxyFactory(<span style="color: #0000FF">new</span> ServiceCommand());
    factory.AddAdvice(<span style="color: #0000FF">new</span> ConsoleLoggingThrowsAdvice());
    ICommand command = (ICommand) factory.GetProxy();
    command.Execute();</pre>

        <p>The result of executing the above snippet of code will look
        something like this...</p>

        <pre class="programlisting">    Advised method threw this exception : System.UnauthorizedAccessException:
    Attempted to perform an unauthorized operation.</pre>

        <p>As can be seen from the output, the
        <code class="literal">ConsoleLoggingThrowsAdvice</code> kicked in when the
        advised method invocation threw an exception. There are a number of
        things to note about the <code class="literal">ConsoleLoggingThrowsAdvice</code>
        advice class, so lets take them each in turn.</p>

        <p>In Spring.NET, <span class="emphasis"><em>'throws advice'</em></span> means that
        you have to define a class that implements the
        <code class="literal">IThrowsAdvice</code> interface. Then, for each type of
        exception that your <span class="emphasis"><em>'throws advice'</em></span> is going to
        handle, you have to define a method with this signature...</p>

        <pre class="programlisting">    <span style="color: #0000FF">void</span> AfterThrowing(Exception ex)</pre>

        <p>Basically, your exception handling method has to be named
        <code class="literal">AfterThrowing</code>. This name is important... your
        exception handling method(s) absolutely must be called
        <code class="literal">AfterThrowing</code>. If your handler method is not called
        <code class="literal">AfterThrowing</code>, then your <span class="emphasis"><em>'throws
        advice'</em></span> will <span class="bold"><strong>never</strong></span> be
        called, it's as simple as that. Currently, this naming restriction is
        not configurable (although it may well be opened up for configuration
        in the future).</p>

        <p>Your exception handling method must (at the very least) declare
        a parameter that is an <code class="literal">Exception</code> type... this
        parameter can be the root <code class="literal">Exception</code> class (as in
        the case of the above example), or it can be an
        <code class="literal">Exception</code> subclass if you only want to handle
        certain types of exception. It is good practice to always make your
        exception handling methods have an <code class="literal">Exception</code>
        parameter that is the most specialized <code class="literal">Exception</code>
        type possible... i.e. if you are applying <span class="emphasis"><em>'throws
        advice'</em></span> to a method that could only ever throw
        <code class="literal">ArgumentException</code>s, then declare the parameter of
        your exception handling method as...</p>

        <pre class="programlisting">    <span style="color: #0000FF">void</span> AfterThrowing(ArgumentException ex)</pre>

        <p>Note that your exception handling method can have any return
        type, but returning any value from a Spring.NET <span class="emphasis"><em>'throws
        advice'</em></span> method would be a waste of time... the Spring.NET
        AOP infrastructure will simply ignore the return value, so always
        define the return type of your exception handling methods to be
        <code class="literal">void</code>.</p>

        <p>Finally, here is the Spring.NET XML configuration for applying
        the <span class="emphasis"><em>'throws advice'</em></span> declaratively...</p>

        <pre class="programlisting">    <span style="color: #A31515">&lt;object</span> <span style="color: #FF0000">id</span>=<span style="color: #0000FF">"throwsAdvice"</span>

    <span style="color: #A31515">&lt;object</span> <span style="color: #FF0000">id</span>=<span style="color: #0000FF">"myServiceObject"</span>

        <span style="color: #A31515">&lt;/property&gt;</span>
        <span style="color: #A31515">&lt;property</span> <span style="color: #FF0000">name</span>=<span style="color: #0000FF">"interceptorNames"</span><span style="color: #A31515">&gt;</span>
            <span style="color: #A31515">&lt;list&gt;</span>
                <span style="color: #A31515">&lt;value&gt;</span>throwsAdvice<span style="color: #A31515">&lt;/value&gt;</span>
            <span style="color: #A31515">&lt;/list&gt;</span>
        <span style="color: #A31515">&lt;/property&gt;</span>
    <span style="color: #A31515">&lt;/object&gt;</span></pre>

        <p>One thing that cannot be done using <span class="emphasis"><em>'throws
        advice'</em></span> is exception swallowing. It is not possible to
        define an exception handling method in a <span class="emphasis"><em>'throws
        advice'</em></span> implementation that will swallow any exception and
        prevent said exception from bubbling up the call stack. The nearest
        thing that one can do is define an exception handling method in a
        <span class="emphasis"><em>'throws advice'</em></span> implementation that will wrap the
        handled exception in another exception; one would then throw the
        wrapped exception in the body of one's exception handling method. One
        can use this to implement some sort of exception translation or
        exception scrubbing policy, in which implementation specific
        exceptions (such as <code class="literal">SqlException</code> or
        <code class="literal">OracleException</code> exceptions being thrown by an
        advised data access object) get replaced with a business exception
        that has meaning to the service objects in one's business layer. A toy
        example of this type of <span class="emphasis"><em>'throws advice'</em></span> can be
        seen below.</p>

        <pre class="programlisting">    <span style="color: #0000FF">public</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">class</span> DataAccessExceptionScrubbingThrowsAdvice : IThrowsAdvice
    {
        <span style="color: #0000FF">public</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">void</span> AfterThrowing (SqlException ex)
        {
            <i style="color: #008000">// business objects in higher level service layer need only deal with PersistenceException...</i>
            <span style="color: #0000FF">throw</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">new</span> PersistenceException (<span style="color: #A31515">"Cannot access persistent storage."</span>, ex.StackTrace);
        }
    }</pre>

        <p><span class="emphasis"><em> Spring.NET's data access library already has this
        kind of functionality (and is a whole lot more sophisticated)... the
        above example is merely being used for illustrative purposes.
        </em></span></p>

        <p>This treatment of <span class="emphasis"><em>'throws advice'</em></span>, and of
        Spring.NET's implementation of it is rather simplistic.
        <span class="emphasis"><em>'throws advice'</em></span> features that have been omitted
        include the fact that one can define exception handling methods that
        permit access to the original object, method, and method arguments of
        the advised method invocation that threw the original exception. This
        is a quickstart guide though, and is not meant to be exhaustive... do
        consult the <span class="emphasis"><em>'throws advice'</em></span> section of the
        reference documentation, which describes how to declare an exception
        handling method that gives one access to the above extra objects, and
        how to declare multiple exception handling methods on the same
        <code class="literal">IThrowsAdvice</code> implementation class (see <a class="xref" href="aop.html#aop-introduction-advice-types-throws" title="13.3.2.3.&nbsp;Throws advice">Section&nbsp;13.3.2.3, &#8220;Throws advice&#8221;</a>).</p>

        <p>In a nutshell, introductions are all about adding new state and
        behaviour to arbitrary objects... transparently and at runtime.
        Introductions (also called mixins) allow one to emulate multiple
        inheritance, typically with an eye towards applying crosscutting state
        and operations to a wide swathe of objects in your application that
        don't share the same inheritance hierarchy.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="aop-quickstart-going-deeper-layering-advice"></a>38.3.1.5.&nbsp;Layering advice</h4></div></div></div>
        

        <p>The examples shown so far have all demonstrated the application
        of a single advice instance to an advised object. Spring.NET's flavor
        of AOP would be pretty poor if one could only apply a single advice
        instance per advised object... it is perfectly valid to apply multiple
        advice to an advised object. For example, one might apply
        transactional advice to a service object, and also apply a security
        access checking advice to that same advised service object.</p>

        <p>In the interests of keeping this section lean and tight, let's
        simply apply <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> of the advice types that have
        been previously described to a single advised object... in this first
        instance we'll just use the default pointcut which means that every
        possible joinpoint will be advised, and you'll be able to see that the
        various advice instances are applied in order.</p>

        <p>Please do consult the class definitions for the following
        previously defined advice types to see exactly what each advice type
        implementation does... we're going to be using single instances of the
        <code class="literal">ConsoleLoggingAroundAdvice</code>,
        <code class="literal">ConsoleLoggingBeforeAdvice</code>,
        <code class="literal">ConsoleLoggingAfterAdvice</code>, and
        <code class="literal">ConsoleLoggingThrowsAdvice</code> advice to advise a
        single instance of the <code class="literal">ServiceCommand</code> class.</p>

        <p>You can find the following listing and executable application in
        the AopQuickStart solution in the project
        <code class="literal">Spring.AopQuickStart.Step1</code>.</p>

        <pre class="programlisting">    ProxyFactory factory = <span style="color: #0000FF">new</span> ProxyFactory(<span style="color: #0000FF">new</span> ServiceCommand());
    factory.AddAdvice(<span style="color: #0000FF">new</span> ConsoleLoggingBeforeAdvice());

        <p>In case it is not immediately apparent, remember that advice is
        just a plain old CLR object (a POCO); advice can have constructors
        that can take any number of parameters, and like any other .NET class,
        advice can have properties. What this means is that one can leverage
        the power of the Spring.NET IoC container to apply the IoC principle
        to one's advice, and in so doing reap all the benefits of Dependency
        Injection.</p>

        <p>Consider the case of throws advice that needs to report (fatal)
        exceptions to a first line support centre. The throws advice could
        declare a dependency on a reporting service via a .NET property, and
        the Spring.NET container could dependency inject the reporting service
        dependency into the throws advice when it is being created; the
        reporting dependency might be a simple Log4NET wrapper, or a Windows
        EventLog wrapper, or a custom reporting exception reporting service
        that sends detailed emails concerning the fatal exception.</p>

        <p>Also bear in mind the fact that Spring.NET's AOP implementation
        is quite independent of Spring.NET's IoC container. As you have seen,
        the various examples used in this have illustrated both programmatic
        and declarative AOP configuration (the latter being illustrated via
        Spring.NET's IoC XML configuration mechanism).</p>

    <p>The preceding treatment of Spring.NET AOP has (quite intentionally)
    been decidedly simple. The overarching aim was to convey the concepts of
    Spring.NET AOP... this section of the Spring.NET AOP guide contains a
    number of real world examples of the application of Spring.NET AOP.</p>

    <div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="aop-quickstart-cookbook-caching"></a>38.4.1.&nbsp;Caching</h3></div></div></div>
      

      <p>This example illustrates one of the more common usages of AOP...
      caching.</p>

      <p>Lets consider the scenario where we have some static reference
      data that needs to be kept around for the duration of an application.
      The data will almost never change over the uptime of an application, and
      it exists only in the database to satisfy referential integrity amongst
      the various relations in the database schema. An example of such static
      (and typically immutable) reference data would be a collection of
      <code class="literal">Country</code> objects (comprising a country name and a
      code). What we would like to do is suck in the collection of
      <code class="literal">Country</code> objects and then pin them in a cache. This
      saves us having to hit the back end database again and again every time
      we need to reference a country in our application (for example, to
      populate dropdown controls in a Windows Forms desktop
      application).</p>

      <p>The Data Access Object (DAO) that will load the collection of
      <code class="literal">Country</code> objects is called
      <code class="literal">AdoCountryDao</code> (it is an implementation of the
      data-access-technology agnostic DAO interface called
      <code class="literal">ICountryDao</code>). The implementation of the
      <code class="literal">AdoCountryDao</code> is quite simple, in that every time the
      <code class="literal">FindAllCountries</code> instance method is called, an
      instance will query the database for an <code class="literal">IDataReader</code>
      and hydrate zero or more <code class="literal">Country</code> objects using the
      returned data.</p>

      <pre class="programlisting">    <span style="color: #0000FF">public</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">class</span> AdoCountryDao : ICountryDao
    {
        <span style="color: #0000FF">public</span> IList FindAllCountries ()
        {
            <i style="color: #008000">// implementation elided for clarity...</i>
            <span style="color: #0000FF">return</span> countries;
        }
    }</pre>

      <p>Ideally, what we would like to have happen is for the results of
      the <span class="emphasis"><em>first</em></span> call to the
      <code class="literal">FindAllCountries</code> instance method to be cached. We
      would also like to do this in a non-invasive way, because caching is
      something that we might want to apply at any number of points across the
      codebase of our application. So, to address what we have identified as a
      <span class="emphasis"><em>cross cutting concern</em></span>, we can use Spring.NET AOP to
      implement the caching.</p>

      <p>The mechanism that this example is going to use to identify (or
      pick out) areas in our application that we would like to apply caching
      to is a .NET <code class="literal">Attribute</code>. Spring.NET ships with a
      number of useful custom .NET <code class="literal">Attribute</code>
      implementations, one of which is the cunningly named
      <code class="literal">CacheAttribute</code>. In the specific case of this example,
      we are simply going to decorate the definition of the
      <code class="literal">FindAllCountries</code> instance method with the
      <code class="literal">CacheAttribute</code>.</p>

      <pre class="programlisting">    <span style="color: #0000FF">public</span> <span style="color: #0000FF">class</span> AdoCountryDao : ICountryDao
    {
        [Cache]
        <span style="color: #0000FF">public</span> IList FindAllCountries ()
        {
            <i style="color: #008000">// implementation elided for clarity...</i>
            <span style="color: #0000FF">return</span> countries;
        }
    }</pre>

      <p>The SpringAir reference application that is packaged as part of
      the Spring.NET distribution comes with a working example of caching
      applied using Spring.NET AOP (see <a class="xref" href="springair.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;41.&nbsp;SpringAir - Reference Application">Chapter&nbsp;41, <i>SpringAir - Reference Application</i></a>).</p>

      <p>This recipe show how easy it is to instrument the classes and
      objects in an application for performance monitoring. The performance
      monitoring implementation uses one of the (many) Windows performance
      counters to display and track the performance data.</p>

      <p>This final recipe describes a simple (but really quite useful)
      aspect... retry logic. Using Spring.NET AOP, it is quite easy to
      surround an operation such as a method that opens a connection to a
      database with a (configurable) aspect that tries to obtain a database
      connection any number of times in the event of a failure.</p>

    <p>Spring.NET AOP is an 80% AOP solution, in that it only tries to
    solve the 80% of those cases where AOP is a good fit in a typical
    enterprise application. This final section of the Spring.NET AOP guide
    describes where Spring.NET AOP is typically useful (the 80%), as well as
    where Spring.NET AOP is not a good fit (the 20%).</p>
