    <p>The goal of Spring's integration with distributed technologies is to
    adapt plain CLR objects so they can be used with a specific distributed
    technology. This integration is designed to be as non-intrusive as
    possible. If you need to expose an object to a remote process then you can
    define an exporter for that object. Similarly, on the client side you
    define an corresponding endpoint accessor. Of course, the object's methods
    still need to be suitable for remoting, i.e. coarse grained, to avoid
    making unnecessary and expensive remote calls.</p>

    <p>Since these exporters and client side endpoint accessors are defined
    using meta data for Spring IoC container, you can easily use dependency
    injection on them to set initial state and to 'wire up' the presentation
    tier, such as web forms, to the service layer. In addition, you may apply
    AOP aspects to the exported classes and/or service endpoints to apply
    behavior such as logging, security, or other custom behavior that may not
    be provided by the target distributed technology. The Spring specific
    terminology for this approach to object distribution is known as Portable
    Service Abstractions (PSA). As a result of this approach, you can decide
    much later in the development process the technical details of how you
    will distribute your objects as compared to traditional code centric
    approaches. Changing of the implementation is done though configuration of
    the IoC container and not by recompilation. Of course, you may choose to
    not use the IoC container to manage these objects and use the exporter and
    service endpoints programatically.</p>

    <p>The diagram shown below is a useful way to demonstrate the key
    abstractions in the Spring tool chest and their interrelationships. The
    four key concepts are; plain CLR objects, Dependency Injection, AOP, and
    Portable Service Abstractions. At the heart sits the plain CLR object
    that can be instantiated and configured using dependency injection. Then,
    optionally, the plain object can be adapted to a specific distributed
    technology. Lastly, additional behavior can be applied to objects. This
    behavior is typically that which can not be easily address by traditional
    OO approaches such as inheritance. In the case of service layer, common
    requirements such as 'the service layer must be transactional' are
    implemented in a manner that naturally expresses that intention in a
    single place, as compared to scattered code across the service
    layer.</p>

    <div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/spring-triangle.png" width="270"></div><p>Spring implements this exporter functionality by creating
    a proxy at runtime that meets the implementation requirements of a
    specific distributed technology. In the case of .NET Remoting the proxy
    will inherit from MarshalByRef, for EnterpriseServices it will inherit
    from ServicedComponent and for aspx web services, WebMethod attributes
    will be added to methods. Client side functionality is often implemented
    by a thin layer over the client access mechanism of the underlying
    distributed technology, though in some cases such as client side access to
    web services, you have the option to create a proxy on the fly from the
    .wsdl definition, much like you would have done using the command line
    tools.</p>

    <p>The common implementation theme for you as a provider of these
    service objects is to implement an interface. This is generally considered
    a best practice in its own right, you will see most pure WCF examples
    following this practice, and also lends itself to a straightforward
    approach to unit testing business functionality as stub or mock
    implementations may be defined for testing purposes.</p>

    <p>The assembly <code class="literal">Spring.Services.dll</code> contains support
    for <a class="link" href="remoting.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;27.&nbsp;.NET Remoting">.NET Remoting</a>, <a class="link" href="services.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;28.&nbsp;.NET Enterprise Services">Enterprise Services</a> and <a class="link" href="webservices.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;29.&nbsp;Web Services">ASMX Web Services</a>. Support for WCF services
    is planned for Spring 1.2 and is currently in the CVS repository if you
    care to take an early look.</p>
